Hi #FNAME,

We recently installed your IQ Fiber service and tried giving you a call but reached your voicemail — so we wanted to follow up via email.

    We reach out to our new customers proactively to make sure the installation went smoothly and to see if you have any questions or concerns.
    Please let us know how your experience was and if you'd like us to follow up directly.
    We truly value you as an IQ Fiber customer. 

Again, welcome — we're excited to have you with us!

Best regards,
